# odin-recipes
My second GitHub repo!
Hey there, My name is Amir Sufiyan
I am a student of the odins project starting from early of this month July,2023 G.C.
and since i have learnt much more things starting from setting up my Operating System dual booting ubuntu 22.04 LTS and setting up my text editor environment which is Virtual Studio Code in short (VSCode).
and then i have learnt basics of Git and GitHub...how to create a repository on GitHub.com and how to clone it into my local machine by entering some git commands from my Terminal and how to push my whole work into GitHub once i have done!
after studying basics of Git and GitHub i have started to learn HTML basics under basics of HTML i have learnt about: HTML elements and Tags, HTML Boilerplate, HTML Text, HTML List, and HTML Link and Image.
now i am going to apply all the above concepts that i have learnt starting from day one until now on odin-recipes project.
