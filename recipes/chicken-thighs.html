    <h2>Baked Boneless Chicken Thighs</h2>
    <p>These baked boneless chicken thighs are ready in under an hour. These tasty chicken thighs will top a salad, fill a sandwich, or provide the main dish for your dinner. Add a vegetable, or another side, while the chicken is in the oven. Garnish with fresh snipped herbs.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons smoked paprika</li>
      <li>1 1/4 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 1/4 teaspoons white sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs</li>
      <li>fresh snipped herbs (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <h4>Step 1</h4>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with parchment paper or foil.</li>
      <h4>Step 2</h4>
      <li>Combine smoked paprika, garlic powder, sugar, black pepper, onion powder, cayenne pepper, and salt in a large, resealable plastic bag. Add oil and gently squeeze the bag to mix oil and spices.</li>
      <h4>Step 3</h4>
      <li>Place chicken thighs in the bag, press out as much air as possible, and seal the bag. Gently squeeze the bag until chicken pieces are coated with spice blend and oil. Remove chicken pieces; place in a single layer on the prepared pan.</li>
      <h4>Step 4</h4>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven, uncovered, until thighs are no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
